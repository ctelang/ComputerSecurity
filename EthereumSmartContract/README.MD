Vulnerable Contracts - Investigate how to steal Ethereum from vulnerable smart contracts. Someone has set up a vulnerable smart contract on the Ropsten testnet that you have permission to steal funds from. The contract is deployed to address 0xFB81aDf526904E3E71ca7C0d2dc841a94B1E203C. The source code is available here: https://ecen4133.org/static/vuln.sol. The contract has two functions: deposit and withdraw that let you send and receive money from the contract. On the surface, it appears that an address will only be able to withdraw what that address originally deposited. But this contract is vulnerable to a bug that lets you extract more. The goal is to make a contract that includes a payable function, that interacts with the Vuln contract to steal funds from it. The contract should let you pay it a small amount (e.g. 0.1 ETH), and then later let you extract a greater amount (e.g. 0.2 ETH). If you look at the (internal) transactions between your contract and the Vuln contract, you should see that yours sends (deposits) less than it gets back (withdraws) from the Vuln contract.
